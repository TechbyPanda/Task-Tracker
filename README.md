# Task Tracker with Tree Structure

A hierarchical task management application built with Next.js that allows unlimited nesting of tasks and subtasks with intelligent cascading checkbox behavior.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application that provides a tree-like interface for managing complex projects and their associated tasks. Each project can contain multiple tasks, and each task can have unlimited levels of subtasks, creating a hierarchical structure similar to a file system.

### Key Features

- **Project Management**: Create, view, and delete projects with descriptions
- **Hierarchical Task Structure**: Unlimited nesting of tasks and subtasks
- **Intelligent Cascading**: Smart checkbox behavior that automatically updates parent/child relationships
- **Visual Tree Interface**: Clean, intuitive tree-like UI with expand/collapse functionality
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live progress tracking with completion percentages
- **Persistent Storage**: Data stored in JSON files with automatic saving
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **shadcn/ui** - Modern UI component library
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icon library

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** - Server-side API endpoints
- **File System API** - JSON file-based data persistence
- **RESTful Architecture** - Clean API design patterns

### Data Structure
\`\`\`typescript
interface Project {
  id: string
  name: string
  description?: string
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
  tasks: Task[]
}

interface Task {
  id: string
  name: string
  done: boolean
  subtasks: Task[]
}
\`\`\`

## 🚀 How It Works

### Project Level
1. **Dashboard View**: Users start at a project dashboard showing all projects
2. **Project Creation**: Users can create new projects with names and descriptions
3. **Project Statistics**: Each project shows completion progress and task counts
4. **Project Navigation**: Click on any project to enter its task management interface

### Task Level
1. **Tree Structure**: Tasks are displayed in a hierarchical tree format
2. **Task Creation**: Add new tasks at any level using the "+" button
3. **Cascading Behavior**: 
   - Checking a parent task automatically checks all subtasks
   - When all subtasks are complete, the parent task auto-completes
4. **Visual Feedback**: Different states (complete, incomplete, mixed) are clearly indicated

### Data Persistence
- All data is stored in \`/data/projects.json\`
- Automatic saving on every change
- RESTful API endpoints handle CRUD operations

## 💼 Use Cases

### Personal Productivity
- **Project Planning**: Break down large projects into manageable tasks
- **Goal Tracking**: Track progress on personal or professional goals
- **Learning Paths**: Organize courses, tutorials, and skill development

### Professional Applications
- **Software Development**: Organize features, bugs, and technical tasks
- **Content Creation**: Plan articles, videos, or marketing campaigns
- **Event Planning**: Manage complex events with multiple workstreams

### Team Collaboration
- **Project Management**: Coordinate team efforts on complex projects
- **Process Documentation**: Create checklists and standard operating procedures
- **Quality Assurance**: Organize testing procedures and validation steps

## 🎤 Interview Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions

**Q: How did you implement the cascading checkbox behavior?**
A: I implemented a recursive update system where:
- When a parent task is checked, it cascades down to mark all subtasks as complete
- When subtasks change, the system checks if all siblings are complete to auto-update the parent
- I used a helper function that traverses the task tree and applies updates at each level

**Q: Why did you choose JSON file storage over a database?**
A: For this project scope, JSON files provide:
- Simplicity in setup and deployment
- No additional infrastructure requirements
- Easy data inspection and debugging
- Sufficient performance for the expected data volume
- Quick prototyping and iteration

**Q: How do you handle state management across the application?**
A: I used React's built-in state management with:
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Prop drilling for data flow between components
- API calls for data persistence
- Optimistic updates for better user experience

**Q: Explain your component architecture.**
A: I followed a hierarchical component structure:
- Page components handle data fetching and business logic
- UI components focus on presentation and user interaction
- Recursive components (TaskTree) handle the nested structure
- Shared utilities for common operations

### System Design Questions

**Q: How would you scale this application for thousands of users?**
A: Scaling considerations:
- Replace JSON storage with a proper database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Add caching layers (Redis) for frequently accessed data
- Use database indexing for efficient queries
- Implement pagination for large task lists
- Add real-time updates with WebSockets

**Q: How would you handle concurrent edits by multiple users?**
A: Implementation strategies:
- Implement optimistic locking with version numbers
- Use WebSockets for real-time collaboration
- Add conflict resolution mechanisms
- Implement operational transformation for simultaneous edits
- Show user presence indicators

### Problem-Solving Questions

**Q: How did you handle the recursive nature of the task structure?**
A: I used recursive functions throughout:
- Recursive React components for rendering the tree
- Recursive data traversal for updates and searches
- Recursive counting functions for statistics
- Careful handling of infinite loops and performance optimization

## 🐛 Problems Faced & Solutions

### 1. Cascading Checkbox Logic
**Problem**: Implementing bidirectional cascading (parent→child and child→parent) without infinite loops.

**Solution**: 
- Created separate functions for each direction of cascading
- Used a single update cycle to prevent recursive calls
- Implemented proper state management to track changes

### 2. Deep Nesting Performance
**Problem**: Rendering performance degraded with deeply nested task structures.

**Solution**:
- Implemented lazy loading with expand/collapse functionality
- Used React.memo for component optimization
- Minimized re-renders by optimizing state updates

### 3. Data Persistence Timing
**Problem**: Race conditions when multiple rapid updates occurred.

**Solution**:
- Implemented debounced saving to reduce API calls
- Added optimistic updates for better user experience
- Used proper error handling and retry mechanisms

### 4. State Synchronization
**Problem**: Keeping UI state in sync with server state after updates.

**Solution**:
- Implemented consistent state update patterns
- Used proper key props for React list rendering
- Added loading states and error boundaries

### 5. Complex Tree Operations
**Problem**: Adding, deleting, and updating tasks in nested structures.

**Solution**:
- Created utility functions for tree traversal
- Implemented immutable update patterns
- Used recursive algorithms with proper base cases
